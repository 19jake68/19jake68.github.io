    During my time at UE I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as a student and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as an officer of *Computer Students Society*.
