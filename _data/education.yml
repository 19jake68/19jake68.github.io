    During my degree at University of the East, I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    While at UE, I spent a lot of my free time with the *Computer Students Society*. I spent 2 years on the commitee as an RnD member, and network admin. During this time, I took on roles from developing new apps and promoting the organization's events.
